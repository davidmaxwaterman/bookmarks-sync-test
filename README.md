# sync-test

This extension is to implement middleware to facilitate testing of
the sync extension from Panic (the Gun testing framework).

It works by implementing the browser.bookmarks API, and making it
available to Panic so that bookmarks can be created/etc as would
a user, and event listeners called as bookmarks are changed.

It would be installed in two browser instances, which would have
their bookmarks synced by the sync extension via Gun - that is what
is being tested.

## Usage Notes

The extension manifest is defined in `src/manifest.js` and used by `@samrum/vite-plugin-web-extension` in the vite config.

Background, content scripts, options, and popup entry points exist in the `src/entries` directory. 

Content scripts are rendered by `src/entries/contentScript/renderContent.js` which renders content within a ShadowRoot
and handles style injection for HMR and build modes.

Otherwise, the project functions just like a regular Vite project.





Refer to [@samrum/vite-plugin-web-extension](https://github.com/samrum/vite-plugin-web-extension) for more usage notes.
